        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp ceviche or ceviche de camaron is one of the most popular Ecuadorian ceviches. Ceviches, also known as cebiches (both spellings are acceptable), are very popular all around Ecuador, but especially at the beach. 
            One of the great things about this type of Ecuadorian ceviche is that the shrimp are already cooked.

            So if you have any health concerns or aren’t comfortable with the idea of trying to make homemade fish ceviche – which is typically raw fish “cooked” by the acidity of lime juice – then this one is perfect for you, especially if you want to try it for the first time. Of course making fish ceviche with fresh high quality sushi grade fish and keeping it refrigerated makes it safer to prepare and eat at home. 
            Once you are comfortable with the shrimp variation I recommend that you try the fish one.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds of cooked shrimp (if you buy raw shrimp, I suggest you poach them in beer or coconut milk for amazing flavor) – 2 lbs = 1 kg</li>
            <li>2 red onions sliced very thinly</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes sliced very thinly or diced</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, red or green, finely diced – optional</li>
            <li>10-15 limes freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>The juice of 1 orange</li>
            <li>½ cup of freshly blended or grated tomato for a fresher style ceviche* (or 2-3 tbs of ketchup) ½ cup = 120 ml</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro chopped very finely 1 bunch = ~50 grams</li>
            <li>Salt adjust to taste</li>
            <li>Oil (sunflower, avocado, or light olive oil) to drizzle on top</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the onion slices in salt water for about 10 minutes, rinse well and drain. This will help remove the bitterness from the onions.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together in large bowl and let it marinate in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, give it another mix and taste. Add additional salt, lime juice, orange juice or other ingredients to your taste.</li>
            <li>Serve with your choice of garnishes: patacones (tostones) or chifles (thin platain chips), tostado corn nuts (or popcorn), aji hot sauce, avocado slices, etc.</li>
        </ol>
